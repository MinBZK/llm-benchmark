# LLM-0001 ADRs

## Context

In modern software development practices, the use of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) has become increasingly
common. ADRs are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development process. These
decisions play a crucial role in guiding the development team and ensuring consistency and coherence in the architecture
of the software system.

## Assumptions

1. ADRs provide a structured way to document and communicate architectural decisions.
2. Publishing ADRs publicly fosters transparency and facilitates collaboration among team members and stakeholders.
3. ADRs help in onboarding new team members by providing insights into past decisions and their rationale.

## Decision

We will utilize ADRs in this project repository and communicate architectural decisions effectively. Furthermore, we
will publish these ADRs publicly to promote transparency and facilitate collaboration.
